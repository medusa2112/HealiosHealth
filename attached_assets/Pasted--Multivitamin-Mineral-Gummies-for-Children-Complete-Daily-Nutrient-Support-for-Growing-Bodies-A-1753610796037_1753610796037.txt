🧪 Multivitamin & Mineral Gummies for Children
Complete Daily Nutrient Support for Growing Bodies (Ages 3+)

🧭 Goal
Support immune function, growth, energy metabolism, and cognitive development in children aged 3–12 through a comprehensive, chewable daily multivitamin.

📚 Research
This gummy formulation includes vitamins A, C, D2, E, B6, B12, niacin, biotin, folic acid, pantothenic acid, zinc, and iodine — all backed by EFSA health claims:

Vitamin D contributes to the normal growth and development of bone in children.

Vitamin A supports immune system function and vision.

Vitamin B12 and Folic Acid contribute to normal psychological function and reduce tiredness and fatigue.

Zinc supports cognitive function and cell protection against oxidative stress.

All nutrients are in child-safe NRV doses and derived from bioavailable sources.

✅ Effectiveness
High compliance: berry-flavoured chewables encourage consistent daily use.

Age-adapted dosing: label separates guidance for 3–8 and 8+ age groups.

Balanced spectrum: targets all major developmental pathways (immunity, energy, cognition, bones).

Free from allergens: gelatin-free, lactose-free, gluten-free, and vegetarian formulation.

⚠ Gaps
Not a substitute for poor diet or serious deficiency.

Contains sugar – long-term dental exposure should be managed.

Parents may assume “more = better” – dosing must be followed strictly.

Not suitable for children under 3 years.
