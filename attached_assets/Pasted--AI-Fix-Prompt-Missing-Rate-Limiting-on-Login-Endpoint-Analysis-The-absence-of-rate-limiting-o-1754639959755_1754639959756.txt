# AI Fix Prompt: Missing Rate Limiting on Login Endpoint

## Analysis
The absence of rate limiting on the /api/auth/login endpoint exposes the application to brute force attacks. Attackers can repeatedly attempt to guess user credentials without any restriction, potentially compromising user accounts. This vulnerability is critical in an e-commerce application where user data and financial transactions are involved. Rate limiting is essential to mitigate such attacks by restricting the number of login attempts from a single IP address or user account within a specified timeframe.

## Steps to Fix
1. Step 1: Install the 'express-rate-limit' package by running `npm install express-rate-limit`.
2. Step 2: Open the file `server/routes/auth.ts` and import the rate limiting middleware at the top: `import rateLimit from 'express-rate-limit';`
3. Step 3: Define a rate limiting rule for the login endpoint. For example, add the following code before the route definition: 

```typescript
const loginLimiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 5, // Limit each IP to 5 requests per windowMs
  message: 'Too many login attempts from this IP, please try again after 15 minutes'
});
```
4. Step 4: Apply the rate limiting middleware to the login route by modifying the route definition: 

```typescript
router.post('/api/auth/login', loginLimiter, async (req, res) => {
  // existing login logic
});
```
5. Step 5: Ensure that the rate limiting middleware is correctly configured to handle both IP-based and user account-based limits if needed. Consider using a more advanced rate limiter or custom logic if user-based limits are required.

## Risk Level: HIGH
## Estimated Time: 30 minutes

## Prerequisites
• Familiarity with Express.js middleware
• Basic understanding of rate limiting concepts
• Access to the server codebase

## Testing Approach
To verify the fix, attempt to log in multiple times with incorrect credentials from the same IP address. After the fifth attempt, the server should respond with a 429 status code and the specified error message. Additionally, ensure that legitimate users can still log in successfully without unnecessary restrictions. Test the implementation in a staging environment to confirm that it does not introduce any performance issues or break existing functionality.
