# AI Fix Prompt: Request data destructured without validation

## Analysis
The issue arises from destructuring request data without validation, which can lead to several security vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection, XSS, and other injection attacks. In an e-commerce application, especially within an admin portal, this can lead to unauthorized data access or manipulation. The lack of validation means that any data sent in the request body, query, or parameters can be directly used in the application logic, potentially allowing malicious input to be processed. This is critical in an admin context where sensitive operations are performed.

## Steps to Fix
1. Step 1: Install a validation library such as 'express-validator' by running `npm install express-validator`.
2. Step 2: Import the validation functions at the top of the file `server/routes/admin/logs.ts` with `import { body, validationResult } from 'express-validator';`.
3. Step 3: Before the route handler on line 72, add validation middleware. For example, if you're expecting a 'logId' parameter, add `router.post('/logs', [body('logId').isInt()], async (req, res) => { ... });`.
4. Step 4: Inside the route handler, check for validation errors using `const errors = validationResult(req); if (!errors.isEmpty()) { return res.status(400).json({ errors: errors.array() }); }`.
5. Step 5: Replace any direct destructuring of request data with validated and sanitized data. For example, replace `const { logId } = req.body;` with `const logId = req.body.logId;` after validation.
6. Step 6: Ensure all destructured data is validated similarly, adjusting validation rules according to the expected data type and constraints.

## Risk Level: CRITICAL
## Estimated Time: 2 hours

## Prerequisites
• Familiarity with Express.js middleware
• Understanding of input validation and sanitization
• Access to the codebase and ability to deploy changes

## Testing Approach
To verify the fix, create test cases that send both valid and invalid data to the endpoint. Ensure that invalid data results in a 400 status code with appropriate error messages, and valid data is processed correctly. Additionally, perform regression testing to ensure that the validation does not break existing functionality. Use tools like Postman or automated test scripts to simulate requests and verify responses.
