ðŸŒž Vitamin D3 1000 IU Gummies (Lemon Flavour)
Daily Immune & Bone Support for Adults & Teens

ðŸ§­ Goal
To maintain healthy vitamin D levels to support immunity, bone density, and muscle function â€” especially in individuals with low sun exposure or dietary insufficiency.

ðŸ“š Research
This formula contains 25â€¯Î¼g (1000 IU) of cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) per gummy â€” the most bioavailable form of vitamin D, identical to the form produced by skin exposure to sunlight.
EFSAâ€‘backed health claims include:

Supports normal immune system function

Contributes to normal absorption and utilisation of calcium and phosphorus

Helps maintain normal muscle function

Supports the maintenance of normal bones and teeth

âœ… Effectiveness
1000 IU is widely accepted as a safe and effective maintenance dose for most healthy adults.

Chewable format improves daily compliance over tablets or sprays.

Cholecalciferol (D3) is more effective than D2 in raising serum 25(OH)D levels.

Suitable for daily long-term use.

âš  Gaps
Not suitable for children under 12 unless supervised by a healthcare provider.

May be redundant if user is already taking a multivitamin with full D3 dose.

Overuse (>4000 IU/day) may result in hypercalcaemia â€” caution needed with stacked supplements.

Not a treatment for vitamin D deficiency (blood test required for diagnosis).
