🔴 Iron + Vitamin C Gummies – Cherry Flavour
Gentle Daily Support for Energy, Focus & Iron Absorption

🧭 Goal
To provide bioavailable iron for healthy red blood cell formation, energy support, and cognitive function — with added vitamin C to improve absorption and reduce gastric discomfort.

📚 Research
This product combines elemental iron (from ferric pyrophosphate) with vitamin C (ascorbic acid). Together, they support:

Normal formation of red blood cells and haemoglobin (EFSA claim)

Reduction of tiredness and fatigue

Normal oxygen transport in the body

Improved iron absorption when taken with vitamin C

Immune system function and cell protection (vitamin C claims)

Ferric pyrophosphate is a gentler, low-irritation form of iron compared to ferrous sulfate — suitable for long-term daily use.

✅ Effectiveness
Formulated for daily maintenance, especially in menstruating women and vegetarians

Vitamin C significantly enhances non-heme iron uptake

Chewable format improves compliance vs pills, especially for sensitive stomachs

Lower side-effect profile vs traditional iron tablets (e.g. no metallic aftertaste)

⚠ Gaps
Not a treatment for clinical iron-deficiency anaemia — therapeutic doses are higher

Should not be used in children under 3 without medical advice

Risk of overdose in young children — always keep out of reach

May cause mild constipation or GI symptoms in some users

Not all iron absorption issues can be resolved with oral supplements (e.g. inflammation-related malabsorption)

🧠 Zero-Fluff Summary
✔ Iron + C = better absorption, less fatigue

✔ Gentle, daily format that’s easy on the gut

👥 Users
Women of reproductive age (menstrual blood loss = iron depletion)

Vegetarians and vegans (low dietary iron intake)

Athletes (especially endurance training)

Teens with poor appetite or irregular diets

Adults with low ferritin but not needing prescription iron

💡 Did You Know?
Taking iron with calcium — including dairy — can block absorption by up to 50%. These gummies include vitamin C for optimal uptake, but spacing them away from milk or antacids makes them even more effective.
