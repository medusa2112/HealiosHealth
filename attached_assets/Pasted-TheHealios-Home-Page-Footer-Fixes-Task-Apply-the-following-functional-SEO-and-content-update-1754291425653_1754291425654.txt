TheHealios – Home Page & Footer Fixes

Task: Apply the following functional, SEO, and content updates to the TheHealios home page and footer. Ensure code is production-ready, responsive, and fully tested before deployment.

1. Rating Section
After the existing "4.48 Rating" text, add Trustpilot and Google Review icons (SVG or optimised PNG).

Icons must be clickable with target="_blank" and rel="noopener noreferrer" linking to:

Trustpilot: https://www.trustpilot.com/review/thehealios.com

Google Reviews: [full Google reviews link provided]

Icons must have alt tags for SEO and be properly spaced inline with the rating.

2. “Trusted by” Brands
Make The Grind Fitness, Eleven Eleven Sports Performance, Peak Performance Nutrition, and Elite Wellness Studio clickable (open in new tab).

On each of their sites, add our logo/name linking back to thehealios.com for inbound link SEO (coordinate with partners).

3. HALO Glow Product
Description → Update to:

Support your skin's natural radiance with HALO Glow Collagen — a daily high-purity peptide powder that boosts collagen and elastin production, reduces wrinkles and fine lines, and supports nail strength and hair thickness.

Above title → Add a badge or heading: NEW PRODUCT / JUST LAUNCHED.

Price → Set to R419 (ZAR only — ensure currency logic applies).

Visibility → Product must only show for RSA visitors (use GeoIP logic).

4. “Trusted by Our Growing Community” Section
Pull live Google Reviews and Trustpilot Reviews via API or embed feed.

Add a toggle button between Google & Trustpilot reviews alongside existing review filters.

5. Newsletter Sign-up
Confirm the date field is labelled correctly — if for Birthday, update placeholder to DD/MM/YYYY and label to “Birthday (Optional)”.

6. Footer Quick Links – Functional Fixes
Shop Category Links

Ensure footer category links filter products dynamically:

Vitamins → Show only vitamin products

Women’s Health → Show only women’s health products
(Verify all category links in footer apply correct shop filters.)
