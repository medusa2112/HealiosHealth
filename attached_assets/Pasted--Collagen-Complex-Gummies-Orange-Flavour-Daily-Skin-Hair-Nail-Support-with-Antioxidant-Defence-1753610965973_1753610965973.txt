✨ Collagen Complex Gummies – Orange Flavour
Daily Skin, Hair & Nail Support with Antioxidant Defence

🧭 Goal
To support healthy skin, hair, nails, and connective tissues using hydrolysed collagen peptides combined with synergistic vitamins and minerals.

📚 Research
This formulation combines 500 mg of hydrolysed collagen with antioxidant and nutrient cofactors known to support collagen synthesis and skin structure:

Vitamin C contributes to normal collagen formation for skin, cartilage, and blood vessels (EFSA-approved)

Vitamin A contributes to the maintenance of normal skin

Vitamin E and Selenium help protect cells from oxidative stress

Biotin contributes to the maintenance of normal hair and skin

B12 and B6 support normal energy-yielding metabolism and psychological function

Collagen is bovine-derived and hydrolysed for better absorption. While some early research supports cosmetic benefits, EFSA does not allow collagen-specific claims.

✅ Effectiveness
500 mg collagen peptides per gummy = consistent baseline support

Vitamin C improves endogenous collagen synthesis

Biotin + Selenium = cosmetic synergists for hair and skin strength

Flavoured orange chewable format = high daily compliance

Non-gelatin format suitable for vegetarians (not vegans)

⚠ Gaps
Collagen’s impact is slow and accumulative — requires 60+ days of use for visible change

Not suitable for vegans; collagen source is animal-derived (bovine)

No EFSA claims permitted for “skin plumping” or “anti-ageing”

Cosmetic expectations must be set carefully — this is a supportive formula, not a dermatological intervention

🧠 Zero-Fluff Summary
✔ 500 mg collagen + vitamin C for structural skin support

✔ Biotin, selenium and E for strong hair, nail, and antioxidant action

👥 Users

💡 Did You Know?
Collagen production begins to decline by age 25 — but the body still responds to vitamin C and amino acid precursors. While ingesting collagen doesn’t directly “replace” lost collagen, consistent supplementation supports the body’s natural ability to build and maintain connective tissues.
