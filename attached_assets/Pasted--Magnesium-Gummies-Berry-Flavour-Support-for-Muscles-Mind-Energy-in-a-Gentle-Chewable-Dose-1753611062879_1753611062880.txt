🧘 Magnesium Gummies – Berry Flavour
Support for Muscles, Mind & Energy — in a Gentle, Chewable Dose

🧭 Goal
To reduce fatigue, support normal muscle and nerve function, and promote electrolyte balance with a bioavailable dose of magnesium in a convenient, chewable gummy.

📚 Research
Each gummy contains 90 mg magnesium (magnesium citrate) — a well-absorbed organic form of this essential mineral. EFSA-backed health claims include:

Contributes to a reduction in tiredness and fatigue

Supports normal muscle function and neurotransmission

Helps maintain electrolyte balance and energy metabolism

Essential for the maintenance of bones and teeth

Citrate form has higher absorption than oxide, making it suitable for individuals with mild deficiency or elevated stress.

✅ Effectiveness
90 mg per gummy offers 23–25% NRV; gentle yet meaningful support

Organic citrate base = better absorption and GI tolerance

Gummy format = more accessible for those with pill fatigue or sensory issues

Magnesium is particularly valuable for high-stress individuals, athletes, and those with sleep or cramping issues

⚠ Gaps
Not a full therapeutic dose — users needing 300–400 mg/day will require 2–3 gummies

Can have laxative effect in high doses, especially when combined with other supplements

Not intended to treat medical magnesium deficiency (requires clinical diagnosis)

Avoid taking near calcium or iron (can interfere with absorption)

💡 Did You Know?
More than 60% of Western diets fall short on magnesium — and stress, caffeine, alcohol, and intense exercise all deplete magnesium stores faster. Even a mild deficiency can lead to irritability, low mood, or poor recovery.
