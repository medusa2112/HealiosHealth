# AI Fix Prompt: SQL Injection in Product Search

## Analysis
The current implementation of the product search functionality directly concatenates user input into SQL queries. This approach is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks, where an attacker can manipulate the input to execute arbitrary SQL commands. This can lead to unauthorized data access, data corruption, or even complete database compromise. The lack of input validation and parameterization allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code, potentially exposing sensitive data or altering database contents.

## Steps to Fix
1. Step 1: Install Drizzle ORM if not already installed. Ensure it is properly configured to interact with your PostgreSQL database.
2. Step 2: Refactor the route handler in 'server/routes.ts' at line 134 to use Drizzle ORM's parameterized query methods. Replace direct SQL string concatenation with ORM methods.
3. Step 3: Modify the existing code to use parameterized queries. For example, replace: `const query = `SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = '${req.params.category}'`;` with Drizzle ORM's query builder: `const products = await db.select().from('products').where('category', '=', req.params.category);`
4. Step 4: Implement input validation to ensure that the 'category' parameter is a valid string and does not contain any malicious characters. Use a validation library like Joi or express-validator.
5. Step 5: Sanitize the input to remove any potentially harmful characters before processing it further.
6. Step 6: Test the updated route to ensure it functions correctly and securely.

## Risk Level: CRITICAL
## Estimated Time: 2 hours

## Prerequisites
• Familiarity with Drizzle ORM and its query methods
• Basic understanding of SQL injection vulnerabilities
• Knowledge of TypeScript and Express.js

## Testing Approach
To verify the fix, conduct both unit and integration tests. Create test cases that include normal, edge, and malicious inputs to ensure the application handles them correctly. Use a tool like OWASP ZAP or sqlmap to attempt SQL injection attacks and confirm they are no longer possible. Additionally, verify that the application still returns the correct data for valid inputs and that no functionality is broken. Ensure that the input validation and sanitization processes are correctly implemented and do not inadvertently filter out valid inputs.
