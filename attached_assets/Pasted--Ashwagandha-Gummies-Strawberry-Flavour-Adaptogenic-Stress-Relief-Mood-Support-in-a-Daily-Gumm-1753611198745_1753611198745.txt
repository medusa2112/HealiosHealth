🌿 Ashwagandha Gummies – Strawberry Flavour
Adaptogenic Stress Relief & Mood Support in a Daily Gummy

🧭 Goal
To help the body adapt to stress, reduce occasional anxiety, and support overall mental wellbeing using clinically studied Ashwagandha root extract in a convenient, chewable form.

📚 Research
These gummies deliver 300 mg of Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera) extract per serving — a dose aligned with several clinical trials, including KSM-66 and Sensoril standardisations. Ashwagandha has been associated with:

Reduction in cortisol levels (stress hormone)

Improved stress resilience and anxiety scores

Better sleep quality

Improved cognitive performance and physical endurance

Note: While results are promising, EFSA has not authorised any health claims for Ashwagandha, so EU marketing must focus on "wellbeing" rather than clinical outcomes.
