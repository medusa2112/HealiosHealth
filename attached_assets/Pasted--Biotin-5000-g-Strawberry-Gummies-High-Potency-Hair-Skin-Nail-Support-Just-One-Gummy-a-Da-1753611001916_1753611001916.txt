💇‍♀️ Biotin 5000 µg Strawberry Gummies
High-Potency Hair, Skin & Nail Support — Just One Gummy a Day

🧭 Goal
To support healthy hair, radiant skin, and strong nails with a high-strength dose of biotin (vitamin B7) in an easy-to-take chewable format.

📚 Research
Biotin is a water-soluble B-vitamin involved in keratin production and cellular energy metabolism.

Contributes to the maintenance of normal hair and skin (EFSA claim)

Supports normal macronutrient metabolism (EFSA claim)

Widely studied for its role in hair and nail strength, especially in individuals with deficiency or suboptimal intake

Each gummy provides 5000 µg (10,000% NRV) — a common therapeutic range used in cosmetic supplements

✅ Effectiveness
Delivers 5mg of pure biotin in one daily chew

High-strength dose with minimal risk (excess is water-soluble and excreted)

Format ensures strong adherence vs tablets or capsules

Useful for individuals with confirmed biotin deficiency or stress-induced hair weakening

⚠ Gaps
High biotin intake can interfere with blood test results — including thyroid function, troponin (heart), and hormone labs

No EFSA approval for claims like “promotes hair growth” or “prevents hair loss”

Results are highly individual and may take 6–12 weeks to manifest

Product must avoid claims implying cosmetic reversal of ageing or medical outcomes

💡 Did You Know?
Biotin deficiency is rare — but stress, restrictive diets, pregnancy, and certain medications can reduce levels. Many users take high-strength biotin for hair and nail support regardless of bloodwork — but results vary, and consistency is key.
