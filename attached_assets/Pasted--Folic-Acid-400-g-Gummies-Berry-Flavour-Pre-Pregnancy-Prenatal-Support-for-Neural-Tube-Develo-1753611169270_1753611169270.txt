🌸 Folic Acid 400 µg Gummies – Berry Flavour
Pre-Pregnancy & Prenatal Support for Neural Tube Development

🧭 Goal
To support maternal tissue growth and reduce the risk of neural tube defects during early pregnancy, while also contributing to normal blood formation and psychological function.

📚 Research
Each gummy provides 400 µg of folic acid (vitamin B9) — the EU‑recommended dosage for women who are planning to conceive or are in their first trimester. Backed by EFSA-authorised health claims:

Supplemental folic acid intake increases maternal folate status

Folate contributes to maternal tissue growth during pregnancy

Supports normal blood formation

Aids normal psychological function and immune system activity

Helps reduce tiredness and fatigue

400 µg/day is the gold-standard dose recommended by the NHS and most global maternity guidelines.

✅ Effectiveness
Ideal single-dose format for preconception and first-trimester support

Chewable format ensures high compliance versus tablets or capsules

Folic acid is the most widely studied and clinically validated prenatal supplement

Can be combined with other nutrients (e.g. vitamin D or iron) as needed

⚠ Gaps
Must be started at least 4 weeks pre-conception for full neural benefit — most women start too late

Not suitable as a standalone prenatal past the first trimester (doesn’t cover iron, calcium, DHA)

Overuse beyond 1000 µg/day may mask symptoms of B12 deficiency

Must avoid claims suggesting prevention of birth defects — only refer to "supporting maternal folate status"

💡 Did You Know?
Many pregnancies are unplanned — and neural tube development occurs within the first 28 days, often before a woman even knows she’s pregnant. That’s why folic acid should be taken as a daily habit by any woman trying to conceive — even months in advance.
