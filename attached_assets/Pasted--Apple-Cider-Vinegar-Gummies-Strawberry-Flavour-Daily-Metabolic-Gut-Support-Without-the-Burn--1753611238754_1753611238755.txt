🍎 Apple Cider Vinegar Gummies – Strawberry Flavour
Daily Metabolic & Gut Support Without the Burn

🧭 Goal
To support digestion, energy metabolism, and appetite control using concentrated apple cider vinegar (ACV) extract in a stomach-friendly, chewable format.

📚 Research
Each gummy contains 500 mg of Apple Cider Vinegar powder — equivalent to the traditional liquid but without acetic acid harshness. While vinegar has a long history in traditional wellness, EFSA does not currently approve any specific ACV health claims. However, observational and early-stage research suggests:

Support for stable post-meal blood glucose

Mild appetite suppression via delayed gastric emptying

Possible improvements in digestion and microbial balance

Many effects are anecdotal or based on liquid vinegar — gummies provide flavour-friendly delivery but may differ in acetic acid concentration.

✅ Effectiveness
Delivers the taste and effect of ACV without enamel erosion or stomach discomfort

500 mg dose aligned with common usage in commercial gummies

Often used pre-meal to support portion control and digestion

Enhanced with fruit pectin base for tolerability and gut comfort

⚠ Gaps
No EU-authorised claims — cannot claim weight loss, blood sugar control, or fat burning

Gummy may contain less acetic acid than liquid vinegar — less potent per gram

Not a substitute for fibre, probiotics, or a calorie-controlled diet

May cause mild digestive upset if taken in excess

💡 Did You Know?
Liquid ACV has a pH of ~3 — about the same as battery acid. That acidity can erode tooth enamel and irritate the stomach lining. These gummies deliver the same dose without burning your throat or damaging your teeth.
