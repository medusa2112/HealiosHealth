Article Generation System Overview
Here's the complete article generation system I've built for OnlineFormations:

1. Professional Article Prompt Template
The core prompt template (server/article-prompt-template.ts) is designed for factually accurate, SEO-optimized business formation content:

Key Features:

Zero AI-sounding language - writes like a human expert
Trust-driven approach with real citations and sources

Compliance-focused: Emphasizes legal certainty and risk clarity
Prompt Structure:

SEO Structure: H1/H2/H3, schema-aligned questions, long-tail keywords
Factual Research: Real citations from OECD, gov sites, PWC, KPMG etc.
Professional Tone: Expert, neutral, assumes financially literate readers
Trust Elements: Bulletproof examples, outbound links, strong CTAs
Engagement: Brief paragraphs, numbered steps, human search triggers
2. Article Creation Bot
The bot (server/article-bot.ts) uses Perplexity AI for research and generation:
