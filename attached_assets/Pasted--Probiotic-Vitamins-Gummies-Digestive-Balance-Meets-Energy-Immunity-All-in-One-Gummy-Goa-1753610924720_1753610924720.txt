🦠 Probiotic + Vitamins Gummies
Digestive Balance Meets Energy & Immunity – All in One Gummy

🧭 Goal
To support daily digestive wellness while enhancing energy metabolism, immune resilience, and cognitive performance — with a synergistic blend of probiotics and essential B & C vitamins.

📚 Research
This formula combines key vitamins with a probiotic blend:

Bifidobacterium infantis, Lactobacillus casei, and Lactobacillus rhamnosus — three commonly studied strains for gut flora balance and immune modulation.

Vitamin B5 (Pantothenic Acid) contributes to mental performance

Vitamin B6 supports immune function and normal psychological function

Vitamin B3 (Niacin) and Vitamin B5 support energy release

Vitamin C supports the immune system and protects cells from oxidative stress

Note: Probiotic strains are widely used, but EU health claims are currently on hold. EFSA-authorised claims apply only to the vitamin components.

✅ Effectiveness
Multi-functional formulation: digestive, mental, immune, and energy support in one format

Gummy format: better adherence than capsules or powders

Live cultures: protected in low-water, shelf-stable gummy matrix

Complementary action: vitamins enhance resilience while probiotics modulate the microbiome

⚠ Gaps
Probiotic efficacy depends on colony viability and strain specificity — not all users will respond equally

Not a substitute for high-potency clinical-grade probiotics in therapeutic contexts

Product must not imply treatment of IBS, diarrhoea, or medical gut conditions

Not suitable for children under 3

🧠 Zero-Fluff Summary
✔ Gut, immune, and energy support in one chew

✔ Probiotic blend + 4 essential vitamins

💡 Did You Know?
Your gut houses over 70% of your immune cells. Combining probiotics with immune-supportive vitamins (like B6 and C) can help maintain your body’s natural defences — but remember, not all strains survive the digestive process. These gummies are formulated for shelf stability and taste appeal, not clinical use.
