❓ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
1. What makes this Magnesium Complex different?
It combines three premium, highly bioavailable forms: bisglycinate (gentle on stomach), malate (energy), and taurate (cardiovascular and nervous system). Most supplements use cheaper, less absorbable forms like oxide or citrate.

2. Why is Vitamin B6 included?
Vitamin B6 supports the absorption and cellular transport of magnesium, and contributes to energy metabolism, hormonal balance, and nervous system function.

3. What benefits can I expect?
Magnesium contributes to:

Reduced fatigue and tiredness

Normal muscle function and recovery

Improved sleep quality

Stress resilience and mood balance

Bone and teeth maintenance

4. Is this safe for sensitive stomachs?
Yes. Magnesium bisglycinate and malate are buffered, gentle forms that are better tolerated than magnesium oxide or citrate, which can cause loose stools in some users.

5. When should I take magnesium — morning or night?
It depends on your goal:

For energy and muscle recovery — morning

For relaxation or sleep — evening
Split dosing is often best.

6. Is it suitable for vegans and people with intolerances?
Yes — it's 100% vegan, gluten-free, dairy-free, and free from artificial preservatives.
