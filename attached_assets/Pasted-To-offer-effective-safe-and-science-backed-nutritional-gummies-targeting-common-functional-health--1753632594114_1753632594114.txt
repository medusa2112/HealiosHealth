To offer effective, safe, and science-backed nutritional gummies targeting common functional health needs: immune support, energy metabolism, gut health, skin/hair wellness, and cognitive balance — all through bioavailable, verified doses and clean delivery formats.

2. Research
All active ingredients used in Healios gummies are selected based on EFSA-supported nutrient claims or substantiated clinical research. Key references include:

Vitamin D3: Meta-analyses confirm benefits in immune regulation, bone density, and reducing infection risk in deficient populations. [EFSA claim ID 280]

Iron + C: Clinical data supports that ascorbic acid improves absorption of non-heme iron, especially in menstruating women. [EFSA claim ID 291]

Folic Acid: Strong clinical evidence for pre-conception neural tube defect reduction. [EFSA claim ID 274]

Biotin: Maintenance of normal skin and hair; most studies show benefits at ≥5000 µg/day. [EFSA claim ID 318]

Magnesium: Supports normal muscle and nerve function, with high bioavailability in citrate form. [EFSA claim ID 279]

Probiotic Blends: While strain-specific claims are restricted in the EU, Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium blends are broadly recognised for supporting digestive balance.

3. Effectiveness
Each formulation is aligned to clinically effective dose ranges:

Nutrient	Healios Dose	Evidence-Based Range
Vitamin D3	1000 IU / 4000 IU	800–4000 IU for deficiency
Iron	14 mg elemental	10–18 mg (women); paired with 80 mg Vitamin C
Biotin	5000–10,000 µg	≥5000 µg shown effective for nail/hair strength
Magnesium (citrate)	90 mg	200–400 mg daily split dosing
Folic Acid	400 µg	400 µg/day (pre-conception)

4. Gaps
No product makes unsubstantiated claims. Where traditional or emerging evidence exists but is not EFSA-recognised (e.g., Ashwagandha, ACV), those references are excluded from official packaging and used only in generic or traditional-use context. Healios does not formulate with novel foods or restricted botanicals.
