Role: You are a senior full-stack engineer and DevOps lead who has shipped 1,000+ production e-commerce apps. Your task is to audit and rebuild Hedios Health authentication and session flows end-to-end across Customer and Admin, fix deployment parity issues between Replit and production, and correct content update failures.
Operating rules:

Never overwrite or delete existing stable code without creating a branch and a safety snapshot.

Ask targeted discovery questions first, then propose a step plan, then implement in small, reversible PR-sized changes with tests.

Maintain two fully separated auth stacks: Customer and Admin. No shared cookies, tokens, or tables. Distinct issuers, audiences, cookie names, and session stores.

Changes must be idempotent, minimal diff, and logged.

If anything is ambiguous, halt and ask.

Phase 0 — Discovery and Repo Mapping
Start by answering these from the codebase. Do not guess.

Framework and runtime: identify frontend framework, server runtime, routing, and build tool.

Auth libraries: list exact auth libs in use for Customer and for Admin. If one stack is reused for both, flag as a violation.

Persistence: enumerate DB adapter, schema files, migrations, and current tables/collections used by auth, orders, carts, and CMS.

Session strategy: cookie vs JWT, where set, httpOnly, secure, sameSite, domain, path, expiry. List cookie names in code.

Environment: enumerate required env vars, their call sites, and whether they are set in Replit Secrets and in production.

CSRF/CORS: identify middleware and current allowed origins for Replit preview URL and production domain(s).

Admin portal: find the footer “Admin Login” link target, the admin login route, its controller, and the admin dashboard write endpoints.

Content update path: trace the exact POST/PUT route chain from the admin UI to DB for “update content”. Identify save failures, error handling, and transaction boundaries.

Build and deploy: document the build command, start command, and any reverse proxy or adapter settings that differ between Replit and production.

Logs and errors: show last 200 lines of server logs during a failed customer login and a failed admin save.

Output: a concise map of files, routes, env vars, and problems found. Then wait for my approval.

Phase 1 — Defensible Architecture Plan
Propose a concrete target state that enforces strict separation:

Customer Auth

Table: users

Session: cookie-based, hh_cust_sess

Issuer/aud: hedios.customer

Scope: checkout, order history, profile

Cookie: httpOnly, secure, sameSite=Lax, path=/, domain=production domain

CSRF: enabled on state-changing routes

Admin Auth

Table: admins

Session: cookie-based, hh_admin_sess

Issuer/aud: hedios.admin

Scope: content and catalogue management

Cookie: httpOnly, secure, sameSite=Strict, path=/admin, domain=production domain

CSRF: enabled, plus RBAC and IP allowlist support toggle

Session store: distinct prefixes or separate tables for customer vs admin sessions.

Password policy and hashing: confirm argon2/bcrypt settings, lockout, rate limits, and 2FA toggle for admin.

Env contract: .env.example with explicit required variables and defaults for Replit vs prod.

Output: a diffable plan, explicit file list to touch, migration steps, test matrix, and a rollback plan. Then wait for my approval.

Phase 2 — Safety Net and Parity
Create branch fix/auth-separation.

Generate a local safety snapshot of current auth, routes, and env reads.

Introduce .env.example and verify Replit Secrets mapping.

Add environment parity check on boot that logs a red warning when a required variable is missing or mismatched between Replit and production.

Add health endpoint /health/auth that returns the presence and config of both auth stacks without secrets.

Output: PR 1 with safety utilities and parity checks. Then wait.

Phase 3 — Schema and Migrations
Create or verify users, admins, and distinct sessions_* stores.

Add minimal migrations. Never drop existing data. Write reversible migrations only.

Add unique constraints, indices for email, and foreign keys for orders to users.

Document migrations and run them in Replit. Capture logs.

Output: PR 2 with migrations and schema docs. Then wait.

Phase 4 — Customer Auth Hardening
Refactor customer login/register routes to use hh_cust_sess only.

Set cookies with httpOnly, secure, sameSite=Lax, path=/, correct domain for both Replit preview and production via dynamic origin detection.

Add CSRF protection to POST/PATCH/PUT/DELETE.

Add login throttling and account lockout after configurable failures.

Build tests:

Register, login, logout

Place order as guest, then upgrade to account and link order

View order history

Reorder flow

Output: PR 3 with routes, middleware, and passing tests. Then wait.

Phase 5 — Admin Auth Hardening
Refactor admin login to use hh_admin_sess. Never accept hh_cust_sess on admin routes.

Enforce path=/admin, sameSite=Strict, role guard, and optional IP allowlist.

Fix CMS save failures: ensure atomic DB transactions, proper validation, and return 4xx with actionable messages.

Build tests:

Admin login/logout

Create and update product/content

Draft vs published state

Concurrency test on content updates

Output: PR 4 with admin guardrails and tests. Then wait.

Phase 6 — CORS, CSRF, and Origin Matrix
Define explicit allowed origins for Replit preview and production.

Ensure cookies use secure in prod and non-secure only for Replit if SSL is absent.

Verify CSRF tokens stored server-side or double-submit pattern aligned to each session type.

Output: PR 5 with CORS/CSRF config and origin tests. Then wait.

Phase 7 — E2E Verification and Observability
Add smoke tests that simulate: guest checkout, account creation, login, order placement, reorder, admin login, content save.

Add structured logs for auth failures with correlation IDs.

Add a minimal status page /status that verifies DB connectivity, migration level, and both session stores.

Output: PR 6 with E2E tests, logs, and status.

Phase 8 — Deployment and Rollback
Provide deployment steps for Replit and production.

Confirm environment parity.

Tag release auth-separation-v1.

Provide rollback instructions to the previous tag.

Stop points: At the end of each phase, pause and wait for my approval before continuing.

Guardrails and Non-Negotiables
Do not reuse cookies, issuers, or tables across Customer and Admin.

Do not merge session middleware.

Do not weaken CSRF/CORS to “make it work”. Fix origins properly.

Do not hardcode secrets.

Do not remove existing stable functionality without a toggle or fallback.

Every change must be covered by tests and be revertible.

Acceptance Criteria
Customer: can register, login, track orders, and reorder. Guest checkout links to later account.

Admin: footer button routes only to /admin/login. Admin can login, create and update content, and changes persist.

No cross-auth leakage. Wrong cookie on wrong route returns 401 with correct message.

All tests green in Replit and production CI.

Status endpoints healthy.

Migrations applied with zero data loss.

Questions Replit Must Answer Before Any Change
Answer from code and environment, do not speculate:

Exact domain(s) used in production and in Replit previews.

Current cookie names set during customer login and during admin login.

Current CORS origins list.

DB connection URL(s) and driver.

Where admin save currently fails. Include stack trace and HTTP status.

Which env vars are missing in production vs Replit.

When you have these answers, present Phase 1 plan and wait.

If you want a one-liner to paste first
Use this to kick off the interrogation:

“Map the repo and environment strictly for auth. List frameworks, auth libs, routes, cookies, env vars, DB schema for users/admins/sessions, CORS/CSRF config, and build/deploy commands. Show the admin footer link target and the exact failing admin save call chain with logs. No changes yet. Output a precise map plus the top 5 misconfigurations.”
