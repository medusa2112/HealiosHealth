The research behind every formula we make.

🧬 Formulated on Evidence — Not Hype
At Healios, every product starts with a simple rule:
If there’s no research to support it, we don’t use it.

We work only with ingredients that are either:

Approved by EFSA with validated health claims

Backed by peer-reviewed clinical trials in humans

Used traditionally with safety data — clearly marked as such

Vitamin D3 (4000 IU)	Immune support, bone maintenance, muscle function	EFSA + NHS
