Proceed to Stage 1 – Content & Compliance Review for Healios Health.

Operating context:
- Framework: React + TypeScript frontend, Express.js backend, PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- Production domain: thehealios.com (all prior "wildclone.com" references are incorrect)
- Core focus: Supplements, e-commerce, AI assistant, blog content

Review tasks:
1) Regulatory & Health Claim Compliance (UK/EU)
   - For each supplement product page:
     • Identify all health/nutrition claims.
     • Cross-check against EU Register of Nutrition and Health Claims (EFSA) and UK ASA/CAP guidance.
     • Flag any unsubstantiated or prohibited claims; suggest compliant wording.
   - Check that required disclaimers (“This product is not intended to…” etc.) are present, clear, and appropriately placed.
   - Confirm ingredient lists, dosage instructions, allergen warnings, and country of origin are visible and complete.

2) GDPR & PECR Compliance
   - Verify that privacy policy covers:
     • Personal data categories collected
     • Processing purposes & lawful basis
     • Third-party processors (Stripe, Google Cloud, OpenAI, email services)
     • Data retention periods
     • Data subject rights (access, erasure, portability)
   - Check consent mechanisms for:
     • Cookies (prior, granular consent; opt-out mechanism)
     • Email/SMS marketing (unbundled, explicit opt-in)
   - Confirm all forms have an accessible link to privacy policy and consent checkboxes where required.

3) Terms & Conditions
   - Check coverage for:
     • Sales contract formation
     • Pricing & taxes
     • Delivery & returns
     • Warranty/disclaimer of liability
     • Governing law and jurisdiction
   - Verify URLs and company details match thehealios.com production info.

4) Content Consistency
   - Search all static content (privacy, terms, cookies, disclaimers) for “wildclone.com” or outdated brand references.
   - Flag any mismatches or broken links in legal documents.

5) Blog & Informational Pages
   - Scan “science” and “journal” content for:
     • Medical advice disclaimers
     • Accurate referencing of studies (no broken links, proper citations)
     • No implication of disease prevention/treatment unless authorised.
