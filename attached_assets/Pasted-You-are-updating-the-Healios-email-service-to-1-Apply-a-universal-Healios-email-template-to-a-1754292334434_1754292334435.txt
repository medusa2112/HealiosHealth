You are updating the Healios email service to:

1. Apply a **universal Healios email template** to all outgoing emails (customer + admin).
2. Add the missing email templates for full coverage of the customer journey.
3. Maintain responsive, mobile-first HTML with inline CSS for email client compatibility.
4. Use Healios branding:
   - Fonts: Chakra Petch (headings), Inter (body)
   - Colours: SAR Green (#3FAE49), Black (#000), White (#FFF)
   - Max width: 640px
   - Single-column layout
   - Header: Healios logo (linked to homepage), white background
   - Footer: Logo, quick links (Shop, About, Journal, Contact), social icons, unsubscribe link.
5. All product images must load from CDN/website URLs (no broken icons).
6. Buttons: Rounded corners, SAR Green background, white text, full width on mobile.
7. **IMPORTANT:** All email notifications (customer and admin) must now be sent **from** and **to** `hello@thefourths.com`.  
   - "From" address: `hello@thefourths.com`
   - "Reply-to" address: `hello@thefourths.com`
   - Admin notifications (e.g. low stock alerts) go **only** to `hello@thefourths.com`
