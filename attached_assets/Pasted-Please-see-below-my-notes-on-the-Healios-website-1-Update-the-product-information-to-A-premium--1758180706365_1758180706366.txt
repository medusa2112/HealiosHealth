5. Update the FAQ section to: 

Q: How long before I see results?
A: Clinical research shows visible improvements in skin elasticity within 4 weeks, with continued benefits for wrinkles, nails, and hair after 8–12 weeks of consistent use.

Q: Is this suitable for vegetarians or vegans?
A: ❌ No — collagen is sourced from bovine origin, so it is not suitable for vegetarians or vegans.

A: Yes — studies show 42% fewer broken nails and improved nail growth, as well as increased hair follicle density.

Q: Does it support skin appearance?
A: Yes — regular intake is associated with smoother skin, fewer wrinkles, and improved firmness.

Q: Can men take this too?

A: Absolutely. Collagen is a structural protein essential for skin, hair, nails, joints, and connective tissues in all genders.
