# Production Email System QA Report
*January 14, 2025*

## Executive Summary
**Production emails are NOT being sent to user addresses** because the deployed Replit application is running in development mode, causing all emails to be redirected to admin accounts.

## Full QA Breakdown

### 1. ❌ Environment Detection Issue
**CRITICAL ISSUE - ROOT CAUSE**

- **Problem**: `NODE_ENV` is not set on the deployed Replit instance
- **Current Value**: `undefined` (defaults to `development`)
- **Required Value**: `production`
- **Impact**: All email routing logic thinks it's in development mode

**Evidence**:
```javascript
// server/lib/email.ts line 515
const isDevelopment = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development';
```
When `NODE_ENV` is undefined, the system defaults to development mode.

### 2. ✅ Resend API Configuration
**STATUS: WORKING**

- **RESEND_API_KEY**: ✅ Present and valid
- **RESEND_FROM_ADDRESS**: ✅ Present (`dn@thefourths.com`)
- **Domain Verification**: ✅ thefourths.com verified
- **API Calls**: ✅ Successfully sending emails (but to wrong recipients)

### 3. ❌ Email Routing Logic
**STATUS: INCORRECT ROUTING**

Current behavior in `server/lib/email.ts`:
```javascript
// Line 517-555
if (isDevelopment) {
  // Sends to admin emails: dn@thefourths.com, jv@thefourths.com
  const adminEmails = ["dn@thefourths.com", "jv@thefourths.com"];
  // User's email is ignored, PIN sent to admins
} else {
  // Would send to actual user email (production mode)
  // This branch is NEVER reached because NODE_ENV != 'production'
}
```

**Test Case**: When user enters `dominicnel@mac.com`
- **Expected**: Email sent to `dominicnel@mac.com`
- **Actual**: Email sent to `dn@thefourths.com`
- **Reason**: Development mode routing

### 4. ✅ PIN Generation System
**STATUS: WORKING**

- PINs generated correctly (6-digit codes)
- Session storage working
- PIN expiration (5 minutes) functional
- Verification logic operational

### 5. ✅ Email Templates
**STATUS: WORKING**

- All 11 email templates properly branded
- Healios gradient design implemented
- Mobile responsive layouts
- PIN auth template functioning

### 6. ❌ Production Detection
**STATUS: FAILS IN DEPLOYMENT**

The deployed Replit app at `https://healios-health-dominic96.replit.app` is not detecting production mode:

**Environment Variables on Deployed Instance**:
- `NODE_ENV`: Not set (should be `production`)
- `REPLIT_DOMAINS`: Set but not used for environment detection
- `REPL_ID`: Present but not used for production detection

### 7. ✅ Frontend PIN Flow
**STATUS: WORKING**

- Login form correctly captures email
- PIN entry screen displays properly
- API calls to `/api/auth/send-pin` successful
- User feedback shows "PIN sent" message

### 8. ❌ Deployment Configuration
**STATUS: MISSING PRODUCTION FLAG**

The Replit deployment is missing the critical `NODE_ENV=production` environment variable.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue
The deployed Replit application doesn't have `NODE_ENV=production` set, causing:
1. Email system defaults to development mode
2. All PINs route to admin emails instead of users
3. Production users never receive their login PINs

### Code Flow Analysis
1. User enters email on production site
2. `/api/auth/send-pin` endpoint called
3. PIN generated successfully
4. `sendPinEmail()` checks `process.env.NODE_ENV`
5. Finds undefined/development mode
6. Routes email to admin accounts
7. User never receives PIN

## Solution Required

### Option 1: Set NODE_ENV in Replit Deployment
Add `NODE_ENV=production` to the Replit deployment secrets/environment variables.

### Option 2: Alternative Production Detection
Modify the code to detect production using Replit-specific variables:
```javascript
const isProduction = process.env.REPLIT_DEPLOYMENT === '1' || 
                    window?.location?.hostname?.includes('replit.app');
```

### Option 3: Manual Override
Add a specific environment variable like `EMAIL_MODE=production` to control email routing independently of NODE_ENV.

## Testing Verification

To confirm the issue:
1. The localhost development environment correctly routes to admin emails ✅
2. The production deployment incorrectly routes to admin emails ❌
3. Setting `NODE_ENV=production` locally would route to user emails (untested)

## Conclusion

**The production email system code is working correctly**, but the deployment configuration is missing the critical `NODE_ENV=production` setting. This single configuration issue causes all production emails to be misrouted to admin accounts instead of actual users.

**No code changes are needed** - only the deployment environment variable needs to be set.
