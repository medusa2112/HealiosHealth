# Phase 2 Security Implementation - Input Validation & Authentication

## Implementation Date: January 17, 2025

## Priority 2 Security Fixes (As per SECURITY_FIX_PHASE1_COMPLETE.md)

### 1. ✅ Implement Zod Validation for All API Endpoints
**Status:** COMPLETED
**Scope:** All routes that handle req.body, req.params, or req.query

#### Routes With Validation Added:
- ✅ `/api/order-claim/claim` - Added Zod validation for orderIds
- ✅ `/api/admin/*` routes - Added validation for dashboard query params
- ✅ `/api/bundles/*` routes - Already had validation schemas
- ✅ `/api/alfr3d/*` routes - Already had validation
- ✅ `/api/referrals/*` routes - Already had validation
- ✅ `/api/ai-assistant/*` routes - Already had validation
- ✅ Created `inputValidation.ts` middleware for centralized validation

### 2. ✅ Fix Exposed Admin Password (ADM_PW)
**Status:** COMPLETED
**Changes Made:**
- ✅ Removed ADM_PW from environment variables schema
- ✅ Removed ADM_PW from ENV export
- ✅ Added comments indicating OAuth should be used for admin authentication
- ✅ Admin authentication now relies on OAuth providers only

### 3. ✅ Strengthen Session Configuration
**Status:** COMPLETED
**Changes Made:**
- ✅ Added `proxy: ENV.isProd` setting for proper secure cookie handling
- ✅ Set `secure: ENV.isProd` for HTTPS-only cookies in production
- ✅ Reduced admin session timeout to 2 hours (more secure)
- ✅ Added `createTableIfMissing: true` for PostgreSQL session stores
- ✅ Configured proper `httpOnly`, `sameSite`, and `secure` flags
- ✅ Fixed trust proxy setting for all environments

### 4. ✅ Complete CSRF Protection Implementation
**Status:** COMPLETED
**Changes Made:**
- ✅ Removed all development bypasses for cart routes
- ✅ Removed development bypasses for checkout session creation
- ✅ Removed development bypasses for admin routes
- ✅ Removed development bypasses for customer profile routes
- ✅ CSRF now enforced on ALL state-changing operations
- ✅ Added comments documenting Phase 2 security improvements

## Additional Security Enhancements Implemented

### 5. ✅ Enhanced Rate Limiting
**Status:** COMPLETED
**Files Created:**
- `server/middleware/rateLimiting.ts` - Comprehensive rate limiting middleware

**Features Implemented:**
- ✅ Strict rate limiting for authentication endpoints (5 attempts/15 min)
- ✅ Admin login rate limiting (3 attempts/30 min)
- ✅ Password reset rate limiting (3 attempts/hour)
- ✅ Progressive delay for failed login attempts
- ✅ File upload rate limiting (10 uploads/hour)
- ✅ Payment endpoint rate limiting
- ✅ Automatic cleanup of expired rate limit entries

### 6. ✅ Input Validation Middleware
**Status:** COMPLETED
**Files Created:**
- `server/middleware/inputValidation.ts` - Centralized validation utilities

**Features Implemented:**
- ✅ Generic validation middleware factory
- ✅ Common validation schemas (email, pagination, dates, etc.)
- ✅ Input sanitization to prevent XSS
- ✅ Content-type validation
- ✅ Request size validation

### 7. ✅ Enhanced Security Headers
**Status:** COMPLETED
**Files Created:**
- `server/middleware/securityHeaders.ts` - Comprehensive security headers

**Features Implemented:**
- ✅ Strict Transport Security (HSTS)
- ✅ Content Security Policy (CSP) with nonce support
- ✅ X-Frame-Options (clickjacking protection)
- ✅ X-Content-Type-Options (MIME sniffing protection)
- ✅ Referrer-Policy
- ✅ Permissions-Policy
- ✅ Cross-Origin headers (COEP, COOP, CORP)
- ✅ CSP violation reporting endpoint
- ✅ Cache control for sensitive endpoints

## Testing Verification
- ✅ All critical endpoints have Zod validation
- ✅ Admin password removed from environment
- ✅ Sessions configured with secure flags
- ✅ CSRF protection enforced globally
- ✅ Rate limiting active on authentication endpoints
- ✅ Security headers implemented

## Security Improvements Summary
1. **Input Validation:** All user inputs validated with Zod schemas
2. **Authentication:** Removed hardcoded admin password, OAuth-only admin access
3. **Session Security:** Hardened session configuration with secure cookies
4. **CSRF Protection:** Removed all development bypasses, full enforcement
5. **Rate Limiting:** Progressive delays and strict limits on sensitive endpoints
6. **Security Headers:** Comprehensive headers to prevent common attacks

## Remaining Recommendations for Phase 3
1. Implement API key rotation mechanism
2. Add request signing for critical operations
3. Set up security monitoring and alerting
4. Implement database query parameterization
5. Add automated security testing in CI/CD
