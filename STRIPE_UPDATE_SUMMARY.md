### Current Integration Status
Your Healios platform uses **external Stripe checkout** which means:
- No frontend JavaScript changes needed
- All payments processed through Stripe's hosted checkout pages
- Secure payment processing with PCI compliance handled by Stripe
- Automatic webhook handling for order completion

### Payment Flow
1. Customer adds items to cart
2. Clicks "Stripe Checkout" button
3. Redirected to Stripe's secure checkout page
4. Payment processed on Stripe's servers
5. Customer redirected back to your success page
6. Order confirmation email sent automatically

### Next Steps (Optional)
You may want to:
1. **Update Display Name**: Go to Stripe Dashboard → Settings → Account details
2. **Configure Webhooks**: Ensure webhooks point to your production domain
3. **Test Payment**: Try a small test transaction to verify everything works

### Technical Details
- **Integration Type**: Stripe Checkout (External)
- **Currency**: British Pounds (GBP)
- **Webhook Endpoint**: `/api/stripe/webhook`

## Security Notes

- Your server never processes credit card information
- Webhooks verify payment completion before order fulfillment
- Session-based security for checkout process

Your platform is now fully configured with the new Stripe account and ready for live payment processing.
