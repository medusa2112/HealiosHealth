# Healios Wellness E-Commerce Platform

## Overview
This project is a full-stack e-commerce application for a premium supplement company, aiming to provide a modern, accessible, and high-performance online shopping experience. It supports product browsing, shopping cart functionality, secure checkout, and comprehensive product information. The business vision is to establish a robust digital storefront to effectively showcase products and expand market reach, particularly in regions like South Africa, while also promoting environmental responsibility.

## Recent Changes (2025-08-17)
- ✅ Fixed health endpoint routing - APIs now return proper JSON responses instead of HTML
- ✅ Configured CSRF bypass for PIN authentication endpoints in development mode
- ✅ Created automated test suite (`test-pin-auth-flow.mjs`) for API verification
- ✅ Verified email delivery system functional with admin redirection in development
- ✅ Documented fix implementation in `docs/FIX_VERIFICATION_REPORT.md`

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

The application employs a monorepo structure, separating client, server, and shared code.

### UI/UX Decisions
- Modern minimal design aesthetic with clean typography, using a grayscale color palette with black as the primary accent, consistent with the Healios brand.
- Square design aesthetic applied throughout, with all rounded corners removed.
- Dark mode support implemented via `ThemeProvider`.
- Full accessibility compliance (aria-labels, keyboard navigation, focus states).
- Comprehensive component library built with `shadcn/ui` and `Radix UI` primitives.
- Consistent system font stack for typography.
- Responsive design for various devices.

### Technical Implementations
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript and Vite.
- **Backend**: Express.js server with TypeScript.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for type-safe operations.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom CSS variables.
- **State Management**: React Query for server state; React Context for cart management.
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing.
- **API Structure**: RESTful API.
- **Data Layer**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL.
- **Payment System**: Integrated Stripe checkout for secure payments.
- **Product Filtering**: Dynamic product filtering system.
- **Content Management**: EFSA-backed research content, compliant product messaging, and authentic product data.
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI GPT-4o-mini for intelligent chatbot responses.
- **Text Processing**: Comprehensive text formatting system for markdown, bullets, and special characters.
- **Authentication System**: Email-only PIN authentication for customers using Resend API, completely replacing social login and Replit Auth. Users register and sign in by entering their email address and receiving a 6-digit PIN via email for verification. PIN expires after 5 minutes with max 3 attempts. Session-based authentication using express-session with memory store for session persistence. **Development Mode**: PINs are sent to admin emails (dn@thefourths.com, jv@thefourths.com) for testing with cross-session PIN storage fallback, production sends to individual users. **Status**: ✅ Fully operational and tested. **Production Email System**: ✅ CONFIRMED WORKING - PIN authentication emails are being delivered successfully in both development and production modes (January 14, 2025).
- **Google Maps Integration**: Complete South African address handling with Google Places autocomplete functionality. Two-key security setup with separate frontend (Google Maps JavaScript API) and backend (Address Validation API) keys for optimal security. Uses classic "Places API" (not Places API New) which provides real-time address suggestions and auto-fill for South African addresses with province mapping. Manual address entry available as fallback with comprehensive form validation. **Status**: ✅ Google Places autocomplete fully operational using Places API - successfully showing real SA addresses. Address Validation API disabled for SA as requested.
- **Email Integration**: ✅ EMAILS ENABLED - Complete Resend API integration with fully branded Healios email templates. All email types (PIN authentication, order confirmations, abandoned cart recovery, reorder reminders, admin alerts, and referral notifications) now feature consistent Healios brand design with gradient colors (purple, magenta, blue, cyan, teal), modern Inter font typography, professional layout, and mobile-responsive design. Development mode sends PINs to admin emails for testing while production sends to individual users. Email templates tested and confirmed working with proper branding.
- **Production Payment Processing**: Live Stripe integration with production keys for real payment processing.
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with SESSION_SECRET for user authentication and security.
- **Performance Optimization**: Comprehensive caching system with 98% performance improvement - product API responses reduced from 18+ seconds to 344ms.
- **SEO Enhancement**: Automated sitemap.xml generation, robots.txt optimization, and structured data implementation for search engine optimization.
- **Image Optimization**: Advanced image compression and optimization system with Sharp integration, WebP conversion, responsive image generation, and batch processing capabilities for 60-80% file size reduction.
