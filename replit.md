## System Architecture

The application follows a monorepo structure with clear separation between client, server, and shared code:

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, using Vite as the build tool
- **Backend**: Express.js server with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui component library
- **State Management**: React Query for server state, React Context for cart management
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing

## Key Components

### Frontend Architecture
- **Component Library**: Built on shadcn/ui with Radix UI primitives for accessibility
- **State Management**: 
  - React Query for API data fetching and caching
  - Custom React Context for shopping cart state
- **Routing**: File-based routing using Wouter
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom CSS variables for consistent theming

### Backend Architecture
- **API Structure**: RESTful API with Express.js
- **Data Layer**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL for type-safe database operations
- **In-Memory Storage**: Fallback storage implementation for development/testing
- **Middleware**: Request logging, JSON parsing, and error handling

### Database Schema
The application uses two main entities:
- **Products**: Core product information including pricing, descriptions, categories, and inventory
- **Newsletter Subscriptions**: Email subscriptions for marketing

### UI Components
- Comprehensive component library based on shadcn/ui
- Accessible components using Radix UI primitives
- Consistent design system with custom theming
- Mobile-responsive design patterns

## Data Flow

1. **Product Display**: Frontend fetches product data via React Query from REST endpoints
2. **Shopping Cart**: Local state management with persistent cart functionality
3. **Newsletter**: Form submissions processed through API endpoints
4. **Database Operations**: All data persistence handled through Drizzle ORM with type safety

## External Dependencies

### Frontend Dependencies
- React ecosystem (React, React DOM)
- Vite for build tooling and development server
- React Query for server state management
- Wouter for routing
- Radix UI for accessible component primitives
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- TypeScript for type safety

### Backend Dependencies
- Express.js for server framework
- Drizzle ORM for database operations
- @neondatabase/serverless for PostgreSQL connection
- Zod for runtime type validation
- Various utility libraries for development

### Development Tools
- TypeScript compiler for type checking
- ESBuild for server-side bundling
- PostCSS for CSS processing
- Drizzle Kit for database migrations

## Deployment Strategy

The application is configured for deployment with:

- **Build Process**: Vite builds the frontend to `dist/public`, ESBuild bundles the server to `dist/`
- **Environment Variables**: Database connection via `DATABASE_URL`
- **Database Migrations**: Managed through Drizzle Kit with schema in `shared/schema.ts`
- **Static Assets**: Served through Express in production
- **Development**: Hot reload via Vite dev server with Express API proxy

The architecture supports both development and production environments, with the server conditionally setting up Vite middleware in development mode for hot reloading while serving static files in production.
