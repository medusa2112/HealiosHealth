# OAuth Redirect Fix Complete ✅

## Problem
After logging in with Replit OAuth, you were being redirected to the homepage (`/`) instead of the admin dashboard.

## Root Cause
The OAuth callback in `server/replitAuth.ts` was using a static redirect to `/` for all users, without checking their role.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed OAuth Callback Logic
Updated `server/replitAuth.ts` line 237-264 to:
- Check user authentication status
- Determine user role after OAuth success
- Redirect admin users to `/admin` 
- Redirect customer users to `/`
- Add proper error handling

### 2. Role-Based Routing Logic
```javascript
if (userRole === 'admin') {
  console.log('[OAUTH_CALLBACK] Redirecting admin user to admin dashboard');
  return res.redirect('/admin');
} else {
  console.log('[OAUTH_CALLBACK] Redirecting customer user to homepage');  
  return res.redirect('/');
}
```

## Current Status

✅ **OAuth Callback Fixed**: Now checks user role and redirects appropriately
✅ **Admin Route Available**: `/admin` route exists in the frontend
✅ **User in Database**: `dominic96@replit.com` added to admin table
❌ **Environment Variable**: Still needs updating

## Final Step Required

**Update Environment Variable:**
Go to Replit Secrets → `ALLOWED_ADMIN_EMAILS`:

**From:**
```
dn@thefourths.com,admin@healios.com
```

**To:**
```  
dn@thefourths.com,admin@healios.com,dominic96@replit.com
```

## Testing the Fix

Once the environment variable is updated:

1. **Visit**: `/admin-login` or directly access `/api/login`
2. **Click**: "Login with Replit" 
3. **Expected Result**: You'll be redirected to `/admin` (the admin dashboard)
4. **Fallback**: If role detection fails, you'll still go to `/` (homepage)

## OAuth Flow Now Works As:

```
User clicks login → Replit OAuth → Callback checks role → 
  Admin users → /admin
  Customer users → /
  Error cases → /api/login
```

The routing fix is complete. Just update that environment variable and you're all set!
