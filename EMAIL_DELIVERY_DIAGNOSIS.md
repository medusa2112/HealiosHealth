# Email Delivery System Diagnosis & Solution

## Issue Summary
Admin login notifications are not being delivered to all admin users due to Resend API limitations.

## Root Cause
The Resend API key is in **testing mode**, which restricts email delivery to only the account owner's email address (`dn@thefourths.com`). This prevents sending notifications to other admin users like `jv@thefourths.com`.

## Technical Details
- **Current FROM address**: `onboarding@resend.dev` (works for testing)
- **Previous FROM address**: `marketing@thehealios.com` (domain not verified)
- **Restriction**: Can only send to `dn@thefourths.com` in testing mode
- **Test result**: Email successfully sent with ID `1ae82ef1-aae3-44bf-917d-d394c8988b32`

## Solutions Available

### Option 1: Verify Custom Domain (Recommended)
To send emails to all admin users:
1. Go to [resend.com/domains](https://resend.com/domains)
2. Add and verify the domain `thehealios.com`
3. Update FROM_EMAIL back to `marketing@thehealios.com`
4. This allows sending to any email address

### Option 2: Use Testing Mode (Current State)
- Emails only sent to account owner (`dn@thefourths.com`)
- All admin notifications go to one address
- Simple but limited functionality

### Option 3: Alternative Email Service
- Configure SendGrid or another service
- Requires different API key and configuration

## Current Configuration
```typescript
// server/email.ts
private static readonly FROM_EMAIL = 'onboarding@resend.dev';

// Admin emails that should receive notifications:
const adminEmails = [
  'dn@thefourths.com',     // ✅ Working (account owner)
  'jv@thefourths.com',     // ❌ Blocked by testing mode
  'dominic96@replit.com',  // ❌ Blocked by testing mode
  'admin@healios.com'      // ❌ Blocked by testing mode
];
```

## Immediate Action Taken
✅ Updated email service to use verified sender (`onboarding@resend.dev`)
✅ Successfully sent test email to account owner
✅ Admin login notification system is functional but limited to one recipient

## Next Steps
For full functionality, verify the `thehealios.com` domain in Resend to enable sending to all admin users.
