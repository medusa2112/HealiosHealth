# Discount Codes QA Report
Generated: 2025-08-10

## Executive Summary
The Discount Codes system QA testing achieved a **45.2% pass rate** (14/31 tests passed). While core pricing calculations and cart operations work well, the public validation endpoint has critical issues that need immediate attention before production deployment.

## Test Results Overview

### ✅ PASSED (14 tests)
- **Price Calculations**: All 4 pricing math tests passed
- **Cart Operations**: Both remove/replace discount tests passed  
- **Stacking Rules**: Maximum stack limit enforcement working
- **Eligibility**: Minimum spend and global caps enforced
- **Checkout Flow**: Discount persistence and failure handling working
- **Security**: CSRF token validation and timing attack prevention working
- **Cart Persistence**: Guest-to-user discount transfer working

### ❌ FAILED (17 tests)
- **Validation Endpoint Issues** (11 tests): Public `/api/validate-discount` endpoint failing with 500 errors
- **Admin API Issues** (4 tests): CSRF token issues on admin endpoints  
- **User Limits** (1 test): One-per-user limit enforcement not working
- **Concurrency** (1 test): Concurrent redemption not properly handled

## Critical Issues

### 1. Public Validation Endpoint (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Issue**: `/api/validate-discount` endpoint fails with passport.js deserializeUser errors
**Impact**: Customers cannot apply discount codes at checkout
**Root Cause**: Passport session attempting to deserialize non-existent user on public endpoints
**Fix Required**: Skip session deserialization for public endpoints or handle missing user gracefully

### 2. CSRF Token Handling (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Issue**: Admin discount endpoints reject valid CSRF tokens in test environment
**Impact**: Cannot manage discounts via admin API programmatically  
**Root Cause**: CSRF middleware path matching not working correctly
**Fix Required**: Update CSRF bypass logic to properly match API paths

### 3. One-Per-User Limits (LOW PRIORITY)
**Issue**: System doesn't enforce one-time-per-user discount restrictions
**Impact**: Users can potentially reuse single-use discount codes
**Fix Required**: Implement user-based usage tracking

## Functional Areas Assessment

- ❌ Unique one-time codes validation failing

### C. Stacking Rules (1/1 passed) ✅

- ✅ Fixed discounts calculated correctly
- ✅ Never reduces price below zero
- ✅ Proper 2 decimal place rounding

### E. Free Shipping (0/2 passed) ❌
- Free shipping discount: FAILED (500 error)
- Zero shipping handling: FAILED (500 error)

### F. Exclusions & BOGO (0/2 passed) ❌
- Category exclusions: FAILED (500 error)
- BOGO promotions: FAILED (500 error)

### G. Lifecycle Through Checkout (2/2 passed) ✅
- ✅ Discount persists through checkout flow
- ✅ No usage recorded on payment failure

### H. Usage Limits & Concurrency (0/1 passed) ❌
- Concurrent redemption attempts: FAILED

### I. Security (2/3 passed) ⚠️
- ❌ Admin endpoint authentication (expects 401, gets 403)
- ✅ CSRF token validation working
- ✅ No timing attacks possible

### J. Cart Merge & Persistence (1/1 passed) ✅
- ✅ Discount persists when guest logs in

### K. Remove & Replace (2/2 passed) ✅
- ✅ Prices restored when discount removed
- ✅ Clean replacement of one discount with another

### L. API Contract (0/4 passed) ❌
- Admin validation endpoint: FAILED (CSRF issues)
- Create discount codes: FAILED (CSRF issues)
- Update discount codes: FAILED (CSRF issues)
- Delete discount codes: FAILED (DB constraint error)

## Test Data Verification
- ✅ 18 test discount codes found in database
- ✅ Test users created successfully
- ✅ Test products available
- ✅ Cart data properly seeded

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required:
1. **Fix Public Validation Endpoint**: Add error handling for missing user in passport deserializeUser
2. **Update CSRF Bypass Logic**: Ensure `/api/validate-discount` is properly exempted from CSRF checks
3. **Add Session Fallback**: Handle cases where no user session exists for public endpoints

### Future Improvements:
1. Implement proper one-per-user discount tracking
2. Add concurrent redemption locking mechanism
3. Improve error messages for better debugging
4. Add integration tests for full checkout flow with discounts

## Pass Rate Comparison
- **Orders QA**: 87.5% (21/24 passed)
- **Abandoned Carts QA**: 96.4% (27/28 passed)  
- **Discount Codes QA**: 45.2% (14/31 passed) ⚠️

The Discount Codes system requires immediate attention to fix the public validation endpoint before it can be considered production-ready.

## Next Steps
1. Fix passport.js session handling for public endpoints
2. Re-run tests after fixes
3. Implement missing one-per-user tracking
4. Add production monitoring for discount usage
